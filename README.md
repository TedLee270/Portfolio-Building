# Portfolio-Building
Following a tutorial from GreatStack on YouTube. The first full website will almost be a one to one copy, however, the main changes will occur once the website is complete.

Took one semester of Web Technologies so I have a bit of experience but I wanted to be able to expand upon my knowledge, keep track of my progress, and continue my learning journey.

I will be using VSCode to edit everything.
